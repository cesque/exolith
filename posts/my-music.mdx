I produce and release music under my usual name *Cesque*. Mostly this broadly falls under the electronic music umbrella, but I also mess around with other genres, especially video-game-inspired music using chiptune or soundfonts.

A lot of my music is available on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7t0L8hVXCaAbv5AiCoCrD5?si=DaZ4b8adRFG2woctkiWyNg):

My Spotify also contains 2 EPs in a series where I stick to using only recreations of the Korg Triton workstation synthesizer to create tracks inspired by such things as video game music, Jake Kaufman's [Kwakfest 1-hour MIDI competition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hmwXThnqi0), and the [Animusic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPwbjO9cbLE) series of animated music videos.

Finally, it also contains the soundtrack to the video game [Desert of Vice](https://store.steampowered.com/app/796370/Desert_of_Vice/), for which I was lucky enough to be able to compose the soundtrack. There is a little more information about that in my [post about my soundtrack composition](/desert-of-vice-ladderhead).
