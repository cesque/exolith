I'm not sure what the opposite of a *stroke of genius* is, but I feel like I had one: I decided to add the ability to zoom in and out on a puzzle. This means some headaches: I have to go and convert all of my code which handles co√∂rdinates including mouse interaction and rendering and make sure it respects the new scaling. However, this is pretty much a feature I would have wanted to add at some point anyway, so I guess dealing with it early is the best way. I'm about half way through updating the codebase to support this new feature right now.

Also, I realised that I didn't include any progress screenshots here yet, so here's one I took just now:

I got back home from a concert and did some more work:

- Added the ability to add new components to the puzzle.

I'm not 100% happy with the way this is coded right now. It feels a little like the type system is getting in my way, which is a bit unusual. I wanted to make a list of each type of component (something like `List<Type where Type : PuzzleComponentWithPosition>`) and then I could use that to automatically create the 'add component' buttons. Unfortunately, I had to settle for just what is essentially `List<Type>` because I didn't find a way to do the type constraints above.

Still works though! Plus I hijacked the preview code I wrote for showing a ghost image of a dragged component and used that for showing a ghost image of a *new* component being added.

As is standard, I'm also still considering my co√∂rdinate system. I think writing more helper functions for converting between them would be very useful ‚Äî the code for the 'new component' preview contains this abomination, for example:

```
puzzle.display.ConvertDisplaySpaceToScreenSpace(puzzle.ConvertPuzzleSpaceToDisplaySpace(puzzle.grid.ConvertGridSpaceToPuzzleSpace(puzzle.GetClampedMousePositionInGridSpace())));
``` 

Perhaps an all-rounder method like `puzzle.Convert(Vector2 position, CoordinateSystem from, CoordinateSystem to)`?

I didn't write a dev log entry for it, but I *did* implement the 'slice' ability for wire editing which was mentioned in the last entry, and it *did* involve writing some code to consolidate colinear segments of the wire. This code went through a few iterations since it's a pretty involved bit of code which is prone to errors resulting in weird things like segments with 0 length, or wires with 0 segments, or other things of that ilk.

- Improved wire dragging in the wire editor, including being able to drag terminal segments of wires.
- Rewrote the wire segment consolidation code to be much more robust
    - This code now deletes wires which end up with 0 segments after consolidation, solving a lot of problems with invalid wires that could be created.
- Added code to handle disconnecting and reconnecting wire ports when the wire terminal segments are moved.

**TODO:**

- Add ability to add new wires to the puzzle.
    - I'm thinking of having an auto-routing feature where you can select an output of a component and an input of another, and the wire will be created somewhat optimally (and then you can edit it afterwards).
- Add ability to add new components to the puzzle.
- Implement puzzle serialisation.
    - It's probably also worth doing another pass to check my puzzle *deserialisation* is working as expected still...

- Implemented the ability to drag a non-terminal wire segment in the editor.
Currently this only works for vertical segments, where you can drag them left and right, but it's trivial to add the other orientation.

I foresee a little problem with a related piece of behaviour I have to add: I plan to add a 'slice' ability which will split a wire segment in 2. However, those two wire segments will be adjacent and have the same orientation, which would as-is extremely mess up the dragging code (or rather, the re-computing of segment co√∂rdinates after finishing the drag). I will probably have to check for this scenario then insert a new wire segment in between them when one is dragged.

Back on the grind after falling off for a bit, not to mention LAN.

- Reworked/renamed methods to convert from one co√∂rdinate system to another.
- Started work on wire editor strategy.

The naming of the methods to convert between various systems used for positioning were unclear, so I'm going to use `Convert[...]SpaceTo[...]Space()` from now on. The puzzle display also needs this in order to subtract the display position from the screen position when converting through to puzzle space, so despite me simplifying everything last time I worked on it, the systems are still pretty complicated üòÖ. Using a consistent naming system should really mitigate a lot of the pain though.

As for wire editing, I've thought about the best way to do this for quite a long time, and I'm still not sure if I'm doing it the right way, but at least I can always come back and change it later...

- Rewrote drag and drop to be handled by editor (ensuring that only one component can be dragged at a time).
- As part of the above, implemented a `PuzzleEditorContext` class to handle editor behaviour and rendering.

The drag and drop behaviour is feeling a little clunky. I'll have to revisit this; I suspect it's to mostly do with the rounding of the drop position, but there are other QOL things I will probably have to add too.

I've also realised that rendering the game with essentially 3 different co√∂rdinate systems is going to be a bit of a pain... There's currently:

1. **Grid co√∂rdinates**: everything WITHIN a grid MUST be aligned to grid. This grid uses integer values only.
2. **Non-grid co√∂rdinates**: the game rendering is scaled up by a fixed value ‚Äì if the screen scale value is 3.0, then moving right by 1 "pixel" in this system is equal to 3 real pixels on the screen. Everything within the game itself uses this co√∂rdinate system.
3. **Raw screen co√∂rdinates**: this is the raw position within the game window, without taking into account any scaling factor. Editor features are (currently) drawn using this co√∂rdinate system, meaning they can transcend the scale factor.

For example, imagine a grid which uses 10√ó10 pixel characters, is 50 characters wide and 25 characters tall. Drawn with a screen scale of 1.0, this would result in the game render target being 500√ó250. Additionally, at a screen scale of 1.0, the game *window* will also be 500√ó250.

At a screen scale of 2.0, the game still behaves as if it is 500√ó250 but is rendered at twice the size, resulting in a window of size 1000√ó500. This lets us do things like fullscreen really easily, and is a desired art-style regardless, but it means that mouse input, which gives us position values in raw screen co√∂rdinates, needs to get converted.

I'm quite tempted to make the editor render to non-grid co√∂rdinates instead of raw screen co√∂rdinates, because I kind of feel like I'm having to juggle between the three systems at the moment. That said... I would still need to deal with it for mouse input? Though that could then get handled in the `InputManager` and I could essentially just forget about it...

> Edit: I updated the co√∂rdinate system as described above, and it probably took me less time to do than it did to write this dev log entry, so...

First entry! So far I have the following implemented:

- Working components with input + output
- Wires between components
- Two different resource types (marble and spark)
- Puzzle view which is scrollable independent of the grid (less authentic, but better game-feel. This will be toggleable in settings, I think?)
- Loading levels from JSON
- Editor mode which can render extra non-grid UI over the normal game
- Editor mode UI using **Dear ImGui**

My next step is to re-implement my component drag-and-drop functionality to be unified in the editor context rather than having each component handle its drag-and-drop itself (this worked briefly but I quickly realised it was going to cause massive issues, so a rewrite now is smart).

After that, I will probably add the ability to draw and edit wires in editor mode, the ability to add components to the puzzle, and then the ability to save the puzzle by serialising it to a JSON file. At this point I will have to assess whether I want to keep the existing level format which came from using Tiled as the editor, or create a new one.
