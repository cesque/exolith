**PRIMER** and **DUALITY** are a pair of playlists created in order to share with my [friend/housemate](https://twitter.com/jakbarnes) what I consider to be an introduction to my favourite electronic music tracks I have heard in the last few years. Theoretically, it was meant to be an introduction to electronic music in general, but I realised that my knowledge lies primarily in a couple of subgenres only. **PRIMER**, the first playlist, is roughly organised in order of 'hardness'; **DUALITY** is not ordered. The playlist art was made by me in Houdini and Redshift, and edited in Affinity Designer.
