This page serves as a sort of index for linking to the pages for the experimental image compression algorithms I have created.

I also created a playground/demo site for experimenting with them and converting images. You can find that site at [qimg-demo.vercel.app](https://qimg-demo.vercel.app/) (designed for desktop use only).

## Algorithms

- **[qimg](qimg)** - image compression though splitting the image into boxes, which each get their own 2-colour palette, and storing pixels as indexes into that palette.
- **[gradimg](gradimg)** - image compression though splitting the image into boxes, and turning each box into a representative colour gradient.
- **gradrgb** - image compression though splitting the image into boxes, and storing each box as representative gradients of its component colour channels (see the end of **gradimg** post).
