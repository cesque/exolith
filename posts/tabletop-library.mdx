The **Tabletop Library** is a site for cataloguing my collection of TTRPG PDFs and other related files. If logged in with a *secret password*, then the files can be downloaded for reference. The site was made after we decided to try to play more RPGs, with the intent to have more easily accessible rulebooks for whichever games we shortlisted for play.

The website is written in **React** with **Next.js** and uses the AWS S3 API to enumerate the folder structure as well as provide temporary 'signed URLs' for files when downloading.
