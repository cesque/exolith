Xenolith is an alternate form of **Monolith**, with a simpler (and smaller) theme. It uses the same GitHub repo, served by **Vercel**, and is distinguished by the presence of a `THEME` environment variable set to a value of `plain` in the Vercel project.

Xenolith is available at [xenolith.cesque.com](https://xenolith.cesque.com/).
