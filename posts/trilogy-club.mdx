From January/February 2022 to August 2024, I took part in a weekly movie club with some friends, where we exclusively watched trilogies.

The trilogies we have watched are as follows:

- The Lord of the Rings
- The Hobbit
- Indiana Jones
- Terminator
- Back to the Future
- Jason Bourne
- John Wick
- Mad Max (+ Fury Road)
- Austin Powers
- Naked Gun
- Planet of the Apes (reboot trilogy)
- Evil Dead
- Ocean's trilogy
- Alien
- Three Colours
- Bill & Ted
- Vengeance trilogy
- Rush Hour
- Men in Black
- Johnny English
- Harold & Kumar

We subsequently changed to a different system whereby we spun a wheel randomly every time we convened, to decide which from trilogy we watched the next movie. This means we had multiple trilogies 'on the go' at any given time. The trilogies completed using this system are:

- Beverly Hills Cop
- X-Men
- Pirates of the Caribbean
- Dollars trilogy
- Dark Knight trilogy
- Sam Raimi's Spiderman
- Fletch
- Stuart Little
- Spy Kids
- Jurassic Park
