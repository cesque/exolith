I take part in a weekly movie club with some friends; the central conceit is that we only watch movie trilogies.

The trilogies we have watched are as follows:

- The Lord of the Rings
- The Hobbit
- Indiana Jones
- Terminator
- Back to the Future
- Jason Bourne
- John Wick
- Mad Max (+ Fury Road)
- Austin Powers
- Naked Gun
- Planet of the Apes (reboot trilogy)
- Evil Dead
- Ocean's trilogy
- Alien
- Three Colours
- Bill & Ted
- Vengeance trilogy
- Rush Hour
- Men in Black
- Johnny English
- Harold & Kumar

We subsequently changed to a different system whereby we spin a wheel randomly every time we convene, to decide which from trilogy we are watching the next movie. This means we have multiple trilogys 'on the go' at any given time. The trilogies completed using this system are:

- Beverly Hills Cop
- X-Men
- Pirates of the Caribbean
- Dollars trilogy
