**FFXIV** (better name pending) is an in-progress site to collect simplified guides to various content in the MMORPG Final Fantasy XIV.

The guides are stored as MDX files, with bespoke components to indicate cause/effect triggers. These are designed to be quickly readable so we can have the guide open on a second monitor while playing.

The site is available at [ffxiv.cesque.com](https://ffxiv.cesque.com) and the code (and source files for each guide) are available on GitHub at [cesque/ffxiv](https://github.com/cesque/ffxiv).
