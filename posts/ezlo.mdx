**Ezlo** is a software I created to allow a user to run a random ROM from their collection, using the assigned emulator. It is built in Electron, using React for the front-end.

The code is available on GitHub at [cesque/ezlo](https://github.com/cesque/ezlo), and you can also download [executable versions of the app](https://github.com/cesque/ezlo/releases).
