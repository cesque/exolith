[whiterosechorus.co.uk](https://whiterosechorus.co.uk) is a new website I designed and built for my barbershop chorus, the White Rose Chorus. It was designed to replace an older site built on the Wix platform, with the goal of driving recruitment efforts while remaining accessible to existing users.

In order to help with recruitment, the site was designed to surface important information such as rehearsal times and location. Additionally, there are multiple places pointing the user towards the "Sing with us" page, which contains more important information about rehearsals including travel information and explanations about what to expect in rehearsals.

In making this information clear and available, the aim is to provide as much support as possible for people who might be interested in singing with us but are anxious about turning up to a rehearsal, in line with our goal of increasing recruitment within the chorus.
