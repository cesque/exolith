**2023-09-25**: I'm on a bit of a DnB kick at the moment, and the drop of this song is nicely minimal but also extremely hard-hitting.

**2023-02-03**: I really love when a song switches up languages – Markella does it perfectly here with just a random line in Greek (there's another one later on too).

**2022-10-23**: the new Louis Cole album has some great great songs; I enjoy how long this one takes to get to the chorus, which then slaps extremely hard. As a YouTube commenter said: "I've never heard a song that makes you wait so long for a chorus that's so worth waiting for".

**2022-10-14**: Yep, it's the Cardcaptor Sakura season 1 ED! We get some nice crunchy chords at the end of this pre-chorus, of which I totally wanna see an analysis.

**2022-09-08**: TK Maxx radio gives me yet another banger; this is a pretty quintessential 'me' song really, and the lyrics are pretty funny too.

**2022-07-21**: This performance is reminding me of how I wanted to sing barbershop when I was young and never got the chance to... and the tag is the best part of it all, of course.

**2022-07-15**: This is a classic. The beauty of the bridge into the brutality of the second drop cements Contact as one of my top tracks ever.

**2022-03-16**: The first few seconds of this song seem to have such a 'potential energy', and a kind of earthiness that really pulls me in.

**2022-01-13**: Great harmonies throughout this song, but I especially love this small mixup of the strumming pattern.

**2021-12-10**: The drop just goes way too hard, what can I say.

<YouTube videoId="NcgEXwjAImo" time={ 104 } />

**2021-12-09**: The \*clap-clap\* is so good.

<YouTube videoId="O8BIfTqeFZg" time={ 35 } />

**2021-12-08**: Switch from 4 to 3.

<YouTube videoId="CnPgo7YQN44" time={ 26 } />

**2021-11-03**: RATS. The main guitar line is really catchy, and the final chord of it is unexpected enough that it keeps it interesting.

<YouTube videoId="fqN6JguMBeo" />

**2021-08-20**: Yolandi Visser yelling... sick.

<YouTube videoId="gWIkiI_UmeE" />

**2021-08-20**: This synth line is just SO satisfying that it stays in my head on its own. The intro itself is pretty great.

<YouTube videoId="Zg5guTIUhZM" time={ 84 } />

**2021-08-15**: Just so intense, I lose my mind every time. It being in 7 helps a lot towards the intensity, too. I should probably play more Ace Combat so I can hear this in situ...

<YouTube videoId="0BnIWrsrNd4" />

**2021-08-05**: The rhythm of the synth chords throughout, but especially the chorus – it plays really nicely with the rhythm of the vocals, sometimes syncing up and sometimes offset and syncopating in a really satisfying way. I also like how C is kept as a pedal note above the whole chorus.

<YouTube videoId="WAmCeYz9D90" time={ 97 } />

**2021-07-24**: "do I have your attention?" resolving onto the 3rd. The whole song does bop though, but this particular bit stuck in my head as representative of the whole.

<YouTube videoId="K17df81RL9Y" />

**2021-07-11**: "from my arms, into theeeee"

<YouTube videoId="xB5SImW6mGA" time={ 194 } />

**2021-06-30**: "BUTTERFLY EFFECT" and following chord change to something extremely crunchy.
