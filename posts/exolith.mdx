**Exolith** is a rewrite of **Monolith** ditching Ghost CMS in favour of writing my posts in **MDX**, and using the new Next.js experimental `app` directory.

It would be useful here to refer back to the four points which I wanted in a blog solution back when I started working on Monolith, which can be seen in [my original post](/monolith-i):

1. **Focus on writing**
2. **Good UI**
3. **Sensible JSON output**
4. **Extensibility**

The lack of **3** was increasingly annoying me with my Ghost-powered solution. I acknowledged my annoyance with Ghost's horrible HTML output in both of my original Monolith posts ([1](/monolith-i), [2](/monolith-ii)), and it never sat right since then. Additionally, I started feeling more and more constrained from a lack of **4**.

Long have I been proclaiming to anyone who will listen: "I like Ghost, but what I really want is *Markdown but with React components*".

Then I read a post detailing that GitHub were going to start allowing some interactive elements in README files through the use of a language called **MDX** which turned out was just Markdown with React components. At least, I *think* I read that post; my attempts to find it again to link here resulted in my own little [Mandela Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_memory#Mandela_Effect).

Regardless, I discovered MDX and realised that it was exactly what I was waiting for. After a period of thinking about whether it was actually worth the effort, I decided to start the rewrite.

This means that I will no longer be using a fancy CMS, so points **1** (*Focus on writing*) and **2** (*Good UI*) are taking a hit. But I've always been a fan of making notes in Notepad, and so, with word wrap enabled, VS Code is a completely sufficient editing environment for me.
And while I wouldn't call it a *good* UI, it's a *familiar* UI. Ultimately, I'm sacrificing a small amount of those things for extremely large (well, infinite) gains in point **4** (*Extensibility*). There's no JSON output, but I would just be using JSON to hydrate React components... and the MDX implementation for Next.js gives me full control over the components used for each native Markdown element if I so wish.

Even on top of that, the jank of my old [meta image solution](http://localhost:3000/next-meta-image) is replaced by [Vercel OG Image Generation](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/edge-functions/og-image-generation) which seems to be a bit more sensible.

There's still a bit of weirdness–getting the list of posts involves enumerating an actual directory of files, which doesn't feel ideal. Overall, however, this rebuild seems a lot more stable and sensible, and means I don't have to rely on an externally hosted CMS. I wouldn't recommend it for a non-programmer, but it's perfect for me.

> **EDIT**: it seems that Vercel's deployment process doesn't keep file metadata like created + updated timestamps. Therefore I need to come up with a better solution for this–[this post](https://joshuatz.com/posts/2019/gatsby-better-last-updated-or-modified-dates-for-posts/) seems to offer a decent strategy: get the timestamps in a pre-commit hook and add them to the commit.
