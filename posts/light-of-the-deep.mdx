**Light of the Deep** is an in-progress Destiny 2 raid concept based around descending into the seas of Titan to save a Leviathan. Note: this concept was started in the period before *Season of the Deep* when we knew that Titan would be coming back; it was thus also started before we knew anything about the *Ghosts of the Deep* dungeon!

## Encounter I — Generator Room

The first encounter of the raid is the **Generator Room**, which supplies energy to the deeper parts of the instalment. This room has been taken over by **Nekreks, First Bastion of the Deep** who seeks to prevent the fireteam from proceeding any further downwards.

The room is a huge circle, with the walls and ceiling primarily comprised of huge windows letting in bright blue underwater light. In the center of the room, there is a circular pagoda with a hole that leads into an enclosed room underground (the Surplus Energy Disposal Room). Nekreks stands on the roof of this pagoda, shooting at the Guardians throughout the encounter.

Evenly spaced around the edge of the room are five plates, and behind the plates there are smaller plates which act as lifts up to small enclosed control rooms. The lifts are activated by shootable panels on the lift shaft (which are not shootable from the lift itself).

When the encounter begins, two of the control rooms will have their lights turned on—power can be seen coming from the central pagoda through various wires across the floor  to the plate and the control room.

One player should stand on the glowing plate, and another should get on the lift behind the plate. The player on the plate should then shoot the lift panel to send the player up to the control room. Once in the control room, they will see a line superimposed over the room, starting at their plate and leading to two others in order; they should communicate this path to their runner who is stood on the plate. They also need to shoot or melee the control panel, which will give the runner an orb to carry. To get out of the sealed control room, the lift panel needs to get shot again by a player standing on the corresponding plate.

The runner then needs to carry the orb to the plates that were shown by the line display in order. Once they have done this, they need to head to the central pagoda and enter the underground Surplus Energy Disposal Room. The orb cannot be dropped, and has a timer which will kill the carrier when it runs out. Their orb timer buff will change when they stand on the correct plate to show that their actions were correct.

The central room will seal after all orb carriers from this phase have either entered the room, or died from enemy fire, falling in one of the various pits around the arena, or the orb timer. The orbs will despawn. If the room only contains orb runners, and each runner has completed their path correctly, the room will open up again and start the boss DPS phase. Otherwise, every player inside the room will be killed by an overcharge burst.

Nekreks can be DPSed from any place in the arena, but twice per damage phase she will choose two of the five segments of the room at random and electrify them, causing a blast in that segment after a few seconds which kills any player caught within. The upcoming blast is clearly shown by the floor changing color and becoming electrified, as well as an **Incoming Overcharge** debuff on each player in the area.

Once the damage phase is over, the cycle will repeat, but each time this happens, an additional control room will be lit up and the players must take an additional orb to the Surplus Energy Disposal Room. That is: in the first phase two orbs are needed, in the second phase three orbs are needed, in the third phase four orbs are needed etc. This caps out at six orbs.

When the boss hits his final stand in the last five percent of his health bar, she will become immune and instead start taking consistent damage over time. She becomes out of control and starts shooting and cracking the glass windwos in a last-ditch attempt to prevent the firetime from escaping, sabotaging the Generator Room in the process. The exit door to the arena will open, and Sloane will appear there and urge the firetime to head in that direction as they start taking damage over time from the room's destruction.

Sloane uses her newfound Taken powers to create a portal to the Ascendent Plane, in an Ascendent version of the underwater installation; once everyone has made it through the portal, the encounter will end and the chest will spawn.

**FIRST ENCOUNTER NOTES:**

- The orb carrier cannot bring their reader back down from the control room since it requires someone to shoot the panel (and the control panel cannot be activated while standing on the lift, so it cannot be brought down before the orb is spawned). Another free player should run across, stand on the plate and shoot the lift panel to return the lift to the main level.
- Boss damage is relatively simple because the boss does not move too much. However, she does spawn Taken Hobgoblins who can snipe the players as they DPS, as well as unleashing Axion Darts towards the players periodically.
- As the phases continue, the number of players clearing enemies decreases, meaning that it becomes a lot more dangerous for the orb carriers to complete their paths. Defensive mods are encouraged for any orb carriers.
- Walking onto an incorrect plate with the orb pushes the carrier back forcefully and decreases their orb timer, making it a lot harder for them to complete their path in time.
