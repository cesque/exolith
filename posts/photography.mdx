I took up photography as a hobby at the start of August 2022, when me and my [friend and housemate](https://twitter.com/jakbarnes) picked up some old film cameras and took them out the next day to photograph [Leeds Pride](https://www.flickr.com/photos/euqsec/albums/72177720302046692) (in black and white, due to a shortage of colour film!). My first film camera is a **Praktica MTL3**, which cost me (lens included!) only £35. I've since bought a lightmeter too, so I don't have to rely on my phone to meter when shooting.

After shooting a few rolls of film and realising how quickly the costs of film add up, as well as the nature of film photography discouraging experimentation and practice, I picked up a digital camera–the **Sigma DP2s**–in September 2022. It's a bit of a nonstandard, 'janky' camera but also takes photos that I absolutely *love* straight out of camera with no editing.

I bought myself a **Fujifilm X-T2** for Christmas 2022, in order to have a bit more of a versatile camera to practice with as well as to take on my impending trip to Tokyo. I have the 18-55 kit lens, as well as an adapter for M42 mount lenses so I can shoot with my vintage lenses I already own for my film camera.

I have also received a **Nikon F301** (film camera) from a friend, which I used for quick shooting due to not needing a light meter. Additional, I have bought an **infrared-converted Fujifilm X-T1** for shooting IR, which I find really intriguing.

What do I like about photography? My initial interest in specifically analog photography combined two of my passions. Firstly, I enjoy old/vintage things–specifically my retro game collecting hobby when I was younger comes to mind, but there are plenty more examples. Secondly, I love creating, and I love creating *with restrictions*. In my mind, creativity is both more fun and more *creative* when restrictions are applied thereon. I have noticed this as a trend in the types of creativity I tend to enjoy: pixel art, 1-bit art, chiptune music, [Oulipo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oulipo)-style writing etc. Film photography fits neatly into this, with my main film camera being made in the GDR in the 60s, and forcing me to be extremely limited in the photos I take, with a limited amount of shots available and no ability to delete (and only non-zoomable prime lenses attached!).

After that, I started to see the other appeals of photography, and wanted to dive more into the creative aspect of it. After all, the constraints are great but also make it harder to practice, so a mix of the two styles is needed. Plus, alongside all of this other logic, it was a way to get myself out of the house and experiencing the world and getting some much-needed fresh air.
