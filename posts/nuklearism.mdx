**nuklearism** is a project to collect media, mostly images, which fulfil a certain aesthetic criteria. This criteria, only vaguely defined, includes mostly inscrutable-looking diagrams, both scientific and occult (usually black and white). It also includes complicated control surfaces and Cyrillic text.

The project can be found online here: [@nuklearism](https://twitter.com/nuklearism).
