**Desert of Vice** and **Ladderhead** are surreal, narrative-focused text adventure games by Karolis Dikcius, for which I was lucky enough to have to opportunity to compose the soundtracks. They are available on PC ([Desert of Vice](https://store.steampowered.com/app/796370/Desert_of_Vice/), [Ladderhead](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1047800/Ladderhead/)) as well as mobile.

The soundtrack for **Ladderhead** is not available online (yet!).

I also contributed to Dikcius' third game, **Strange Aeons**, which uses in parts a constructed language generation library I wrote called [yod](https://github.com/cesque/yod).
